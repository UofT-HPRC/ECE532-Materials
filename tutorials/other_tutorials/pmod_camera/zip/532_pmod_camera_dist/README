To build the reference design, include the source and constraint files in
src/ as well as the two IPs in src/ip/.

You may also generate the IPs yourself. You would need to generate the
following:

1) blk_mem_gen_0 : Block Memory Generator
  Memory Type: Simple Dual Port RAM
  Port A Options:
    - Width 16
    - Depth 76800
    - Enable Port Type: Always Enabled
  Port B Options:
    - Enable Port Type: Always Enabled

2) clock_wiz_0 : Clocking Wizard
  - 100 MHz Single ended source
  - Two Output Clocks:
      - clk_out1: 50 MHz
      - clk_out2: 25 MHz
  - "Enable Options Inputs / Outputs" : uncheck reset

As a quick check to see if you configured the cores properly, make sure the
ports shown in the customize IP dialog match the Verilog ports for the blocks
in src/ov7670_top.v
